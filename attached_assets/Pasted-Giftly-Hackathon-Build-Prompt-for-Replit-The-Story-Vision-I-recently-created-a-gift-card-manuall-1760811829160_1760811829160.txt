Giftly - Hackathon Build Prompt for Replit
The Story & Vision
I recently created a gift card manually for a friend before his birthday lunch. He was going to get his BMW X5 washed at his favorite local car wash before meeting us. I used ChatGPT to combine an image of his BMW with the car wash's branding, then embedded a link to a virtual card I'd bought him. It worked, but it was super clunky and required a lot of hand-holding.
The Vision: What if creating a personalized gift card for ANY local merchant was as easy as buying a Starbucks gift card online?
That's Giftly. You paste a local business URL, AI generates a beautiful branded gift card, you load it with real money via Stripe, and the recipient gets it in their Apple/Google Pay wallet instantly.

What to Simplify/Skip for Demo
Skip:

User authentication/login
Database (use in-memory storage)
Email notifications
SMS (use QR code + shareable link instead)
Gift history/tracking
Real web scraping (just fetch URL and extract what you can)

Simplify:

Card design: Use Claude to suggest colors/theme, render with React + Tailwind
No image generation: Use emoji/icons + gradient backgrounds
Manual card details reveal: Show card number, CVV, expiry if wallet provisioning has issues

Demo Flow (Car Wash Example)
The Setup:
"I'm headed to lunch with my friend Jake for his birthday. He's obsessed with this local car wash called Sparkle Auto Spa - always gets his BMW X5 detailed there before special occasions. They don't sell gift cards, and I want to send him something before lunch starts in an hour."
The Demo:

Open giftly.app on laptop
Click "Create a Gift"
Paste car wash URL: https://sparkleautospa.com
Click "Analyze with AI"
Claude analyzes page (show loading)
Beautiful gift card generates with car wash branding (blues, clean design, car emoji)
Set value to $75
Add message: "Happy Birthday! Get the X5 detailed before lunch 🚗"
Enter Jake's name and phone: +1-555-0123
Click "Purchase & Send"
Pay with Stripe ($75)
Success! Shows shareable link + QR code
Pull out demo phone, scan QR code
Phone opens gift page with branded card
Shows message and $75 value
Tap "Add to Apple Pay"
Apple Wallet opens, card slides in
Confetti animation!
Open Wallet app - show real Stripe card with $75
"Now Jake has a real Visa in his wallet. He can use it at Sparkle Auto Spa... or anywhere. But the personal touch means he'll probably use it where I intended."

Technical Requirements
Claude Integration:

Prompt Claude to analyze business webpage
Extract structured data (JSON response)
Use Claude's vision if webpage has images
Fallback to business name extraction if analysis fails

Stripe Issuing:
javascript// Create cardholder
const cardholder = await stripe.issuing.cardholders.create({
  name: recipientName,
  email: recipientEmail,
  phone_number: recipientPhone,
  billing: { address: { line1: '123 Main St', city: 'Austin', state: 'TX', postal_code: '78701', country: 'US' } },
  type: 'individual'
});

// Create virtual card with spending limit
const card = await stripe.issuing.cards.create({
  cardholder: cardholder.id,
  currency: 'usd',
  type: 'virtual',
  status: 'active',
  spending_controls: {
    spending_limits: [{ amount: giftAmount * 100, interval: 'all_time' }]
  }
});

// Provision to Apple Pay
const provisionData = await stripe.issuing.cards.deliverCard(card.id, {
  type: 'digital_wallet',
  digital_wallet: { type: 'apple_pay' }
});
```

**Gift Card Design:**
- Use Tailwind gradients for backgrounds
- Business name in large font
- Gift amount prominently displayed
- Personal message in script/elegant font
- Car emoji or relevant icon
- Responsive design (looks good on mobile)

The Pitch
"Last-minute gifting sucks. Generic Amazon cards feel impersonal. Local businesses don't sell gift cards. I spent hours manually creating one gift card for a friend.
Giftly makes this as easy as buying a Starbucks card - but for ANY local business. Paste a URL, AI creates a beautiful branded card, real money loads via Stripe, and it goes straight to their phone's wallet.
Built in 4 hours on Replit. Powered by Stripe Issuing and Claude AI. Ready to ship."

Build this app. Focus on making the demo flow work perfectly. Prioritize the "wow" moment of the card sliding into Apple Pay. Make it beautiful. Make it fast. Make it win.
